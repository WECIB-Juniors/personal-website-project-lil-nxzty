        <ul>
            <li>My love for sports have condensed into dedication for one sole sport: Soccer. Despite loving this sport, my lazyness dulls my motivation.</li>
            <li>I have recently started looking into chess, as i've heard it tests your problem solving skills. I would love to have more time to study this beautiful game</li>
            <li>Thinking, I love thinking. I don't know what living alone be feel like, but i don't think it would be that bad to only have your thoughts as companions.</li>
            <li>My favorite coping mechanism is playing the piano. It's like eating food, if you want to eat good you have to cook good, So i need to learn how to create music</li>
            <li>I talk a lot about food, but i feel like i could talk even more. Cooking is also a passion of mine that i resort to whenever possible.</li>
